# Hackathon - Deployed Full Stack Challenge 💪🏆🪝

Your challenge is to ideate, plan, and build a full stack app that includes the requirements below. You can use this repository for your front end. For your back end, one person in your team can create another repository for the back end and add your pair/team as contributors. (Pop a link to your team's back end repository in this readme.)

What you build is up to you - use the steps that we've learned throughout the course to ensure your MVP is well-planned and managable for a day-long project (with a list of stretch goals to dip into as well!).

Start simple and get your first iteration MVP of your app working as your first priority, and then iterate!

## Requirements

- Deployed front and back ends that talk to each other
- Use of the `useContext` hook somewhere in your app
- Use of at least one custom hook somewhere in your app

✅ Back end infrastructure - create a repo on personal gitHub account - setup database on railway - populate database with initial test values (manual) - cors middleware (allow permission when linking up later)

✅ Front end create React App - create react app - component file structure - import into app main

✅ Deployment (enabling auto-redeploy) - Front end - netlify - build command/ directory - enable auto-deploy - env variables (allowing connection to back end) - Back end - use Render - set up env variables in back end deployment - build command (npm i & npm start)

✅ Back-end functionality - GET ALL route - Database - populate from useContext resource
populate database with data from useContext spreadsheet

✅ Front-end functionality - Components - fetch from back end (link to back-end repo) - useFetch (custom hook MVP goal)
